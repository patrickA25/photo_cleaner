# Photo Cleaner
This repo will look at two different directories and see what photos are doubles. It will be written in python

## ToDo List:
* get list of all objects two different directories
* find way to see what photos are doubles and thus do not need to be kept
* move photos from the second directory and add them to a place that can be removed later data
* build testing file to ensure the functions are working properlpy
